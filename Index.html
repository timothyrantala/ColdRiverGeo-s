        <h2>History of Cold River Geo's.</h2>
        <p>We started with pretty humble beginings like most small companies.
          It began with a simple google "tangent" of places to stay near
          <em>Big Bend National Park</em>. I stumbled upon an inflatable dome,
          with unobstructed views of the beautiful desert sky. I was facinated with
          the concept of this unusual structure, never before had I seen a formation
          that put you more in touch with nature.The only issue was how I viewed the
          <em>materials</em> it was made of, which seemed to be a cheap plastic
          material. This in turn sent me on another google "tangent", finding a
          construct that would satisfy both the nature aspect as well as the quality
          aspect. This led me into to the <strong>Geodesic dome world</strong>. It was
          inspiring learning of the first Geodesic structure built by
          Walther Bauersfeld, which gained fame in the United States due to
          arguable the most famous perpetuator of geodesic dome's, <em>R. Buckminster Fuller</em>. I followed
          the path to it's conclusion which led to a
          <a href="https://www.whitepod.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Whitepod02-1-of-1.jpg">
            Beautiful Resort.</a> When I saw the potential of these eccentric abodes, I
          knew this was what I should invest my time and energy into. Soon I started
          formulating idea's: location, cost, timeframe to build, and possible business partners.
          This is where my business partner "Steven" steps in, while working nights
          with Steven I began to tell him of my "brilliant plan" lol. It was definetly lacking
          in brilliance at the time, even though there was a seed of something within my
          ramblings. We decided that night to become partners in this adventure.
          Soon we found a location we both agreed would provide a great vacation spot,
          as well as something we could afford with our meager budget. It was around
          Leakey, Tx, which resides on the Frio River, hence our name. And so our tale
          began!

  <h3>Benefits of "Dome" Living</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Domes are more efficient energy wise, due to the increase in air
      circulation.</li>
    <li>In-touch with nature experience, if you have never experienced
      a 9ftx 12ft unobstructed view into the mountain side, it will instill a reverence for
      mother Earth that isn't possible in most of our lives in this day and age.
